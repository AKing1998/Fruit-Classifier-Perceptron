# Fruit-Classifier-Perceptron
This is to classify any types of fruit into good or bad by first learning what a good fruit is and what a bad one is.
This will discribe how the Python Version of the code is being run. This will apply to C and R as well with only changes being the syntax.

First we initialze the values. 
`l=0.25  
y=0  
w=[0,0,0,0]  
dw=[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]  
`
